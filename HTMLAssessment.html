			<strong>The </strong> sky was painted in shades of lavender and rose as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the quiet park. A light breeze rustled the leaves of the old oak trees, carrying the scent of fresh grass and something faintly floral. People lingered on benches, soaking in the last warmth of the day, reluctant to give in to the night’s chill. Somewhere in the distance, a dog barked once, then silence resumed its steady rhythm.

			<em> <strong>In </strong> a dusty corner of the antique shop, nestled between a cracked porcelain doll and a stack of yellowing books, sat a curious brass compass. Its needle spun wildly as if trying to escape its glass prison, refusing to point north. The owner, a soft-spoken man with thick glasses, claimed it once belonged to a sea captain who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Most customers passed it by, unaware of its legend, but occasionally a child would pause, entranced by its restless motion.</em>

			<strong>Amara</strong>s had never liked routines, but lately, her life seemed stuck in one. Wake, work, walk, sleep—each day like the one before. Yet every morning, she passed a blue door on her way to the café, and something about it always caught her eye. It was old, slightly crooked, and bore no number. One day, curiosity won. She paused, reached out, and knocked. What she expected, she didn’t know. What she found changed everything.
